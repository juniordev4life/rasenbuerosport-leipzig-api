## What Is This?

The RasenBürosport Leipzig API is the backend service (Playmaker) that powers the [RasenBürosport Leipzig App](https://github.com/juniordev4life/rasenbuerosport-leipzig-app). It handles everything from user authentication and game recording to AI-powered match reports, predictions, and a full-featured statistics engine with 15 unlockable badges.

---

## Architecture

```
Client Request
  → Fastify Route (auto-loaded from src/api/routes/)
    → Authentication Middleware (Supabase JWT)
    → JSON Schema Validation (params, query, body)
    → Controller (request/response handling)
      → Service (business logic)
        → Supabase PostgreSQL / Claude API
    → Standardized JSON Response
```

The API follows a strict **layered architecture** — Routes define endpoints, Controllers handle HTTP concerns, and Services contain all business logic and data access.

## AI Features

Three AI features powered by **Claude Sonnet 4** make RasenBürosport unique:

### 1. FC26 Stats Extraction (Vision)

Upload a screenshot of FC26's post-match statistics screen. **Claude Vision** analyzes the image and automatically extracts all 18 stat categories — from possession and xG to yellow cards and dribbling success rate. Works with German and English game language.

### 2. Match Prediction

When players and teams are selected in the game wizard, the API generates a pre-match prediction based on career statistics, H2H records, current form, and xG efficiency. The prediction is entertaining, data-driven, and includes a score estimate.

### 3. Match Report

After a game with FC26 statistics, the API generates a German-language match commentary (3-5 sentences). It detects narratives like underdog victories, xG over-performance, dramatic comebacks, and career milestones.

| **Favorite Team** | Most selected team |

## Authentication

The API uses **Supabase Auth** with JWT-based authentication:

1. Users register or login via `/api/v1/auth/register` or `/api/v1/auth/login`
2. Supabase returns a JWT access token
3. Subsequent requests include the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. The `requireAuth` middleware verifies the token against Supabase Auth
5. The authenticated user is attached to `request.user`

The **leaderboard** and **health check** endpoints are public — all other endpoints require authentication.

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **profiles** | User profiles (username, avatar) |
| **games** | Match records with scores, timelines, stats |
| **game_players** | Links players to games with team assignment |

## Security

| Layer | Implementation |
|-------|---------------|
| **Helmet** | Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) |
| **CORS** | Configurable origin (default: `localhost:5173`) |
| **Rate Limiting** | 250 requests per minute per IP |
| **JWT Verification** | Supabase Auth token validation |
| **Input Validation** | JSON Schema on all endpoints |

## Response Format

All endpoints return a standardized JSON response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "title": "Success",
  "message": "Games retrieved",
  "data": { },
  "error": []
}
```

Error responses follow the same structure with appropriate status codes and error messages in the `error` array.
